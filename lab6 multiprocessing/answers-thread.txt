If 2 threads t1 and t2 both want to insert to a bucket, and enter function insert with the same p and n, e.g.
    ->entry1->entry2->entry3->NULL
Say thread t1 completes insert first
    ->t1->entry1->entry2->entry3->NULL
thread t2 does not know about the above modification. It will still take entry1 as the first entry in the chain.
    ->t2->entry1->entry2->entry3->NULL
            ^
            |
            t1
So no pointer is pointed to t1, and there is no way to access t1. Entry t1 is lost.
This situation can happen from time to time, and a whole bunch of entries are lost.
